Land was at the centre of the independence struggle in Zimbabwe. At independence from the United Kingdom in 1980, the Zimbabwean authorities were empowered to buy back land from white farmers. As long as land was bought and sold on a willing basis, the British government would finance half the cost. In the late 1990s, Prime Minister Tony Blair terminated this arrangement, repudiating the UK commitments to land reform. The "fast track" land reforms, confiscations and farm invasions of the 2000s resulted in the changing hands of much of the former white farm land. As of 2011, 237,858 Zimbabwean households had been provided with access to land under the reform programme. Below shows land allocation in Rhodesia in the 1906's compared to the modern situation in Zimbabwe. The classifications and color codes differ though the vast scale of change in land ownership is clear.
