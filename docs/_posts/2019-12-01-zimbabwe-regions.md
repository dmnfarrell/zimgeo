Zimbabwe is divided into eight provinces and two cities with provincial status, for administrative purposes. Each province has a provincial capital. Provinces are divided into districts, which are divided into wards. In the 1980s, Mashonaland North and South became three provinces, and the capital, Harare, was made a province. The youngest province, Bulawayo, was split from Matabeleland North in 1997.
